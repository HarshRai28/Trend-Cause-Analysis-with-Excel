# NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis

## Overview
This project explores motor vehicle collisions in New York City using Excel. The analysis includes pattern recognition across time, geography, and contributing factors to support city planning and traffic safety improvements.

## Objectives
- Identify monthly or seasonal spikes in accident volume
- Map collision density by location (borough or ZIP code)
- Analyze leading causes of collisions
- Present recommendations to reduce traffic accidents

## Key Insights

üö¶ **Seasonality**: Collisions peaked in [e.g., winter months] due to [weather-related causes].

üìç **Hotspots**: The Bronx and Brooklyn reported the highest incident densities.

üîç **Top Causes**: Driver distraction and failure to yield were among the leading contributors.

## Visual Elements
- **Line chart**: Monthly collision trends
- **Heat map**: ZIP codes with highest incidents
