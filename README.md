About this project
Overview

This project explores motor vehicle collisions in New York City using Excel. The analysis includes pattern recognition across time, geography, and contributing factors to support city planning and traffic safety improvements.

Objectives

Identify monthly or seasonal spikes in accident volume
Map collision density by location (borough or ZIP code)
Analyze leading causes of collisions
Present recommendations to reduce traffic accidents
Key Insights

🚦Seasonality: Collisions peaked in [e.g., winter months] due to [weather-related causes].
📍Hotspots: The Bronx and Brooklyn reported the highest incident densities.
🔍Top Causes: Driver distraction and failure to yield were among the leading contributors.
📊High-Risk Timing: Weekends and evening hours showed elevated crash frequency.
Tools Used

Excel (PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Charts, Heatmaps)
Excel Power Query (IF & SUM used for cleaning/filtering)
Visual Elements

Line chart: Monthly collision trends
Heat map: ZIP codes with highest incidents
Table: Top 10 locations by accident count

Recommendations
Increase police presence or surveillance in hotspots
Educate drivers on distracted driving and failure-to-yield risks
Use insights to prioritize improvements for traffic signal timing or signage
